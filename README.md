This is a representation of the note ids on the launchpad mini mk3


The sounds are stored in the `sounds/` directory.
The first digit of the note ids in the image above represents the directory, the second digit the filename.

Ex. ID 45 would be directory `4` and in this directory a file named `5.mp3`
